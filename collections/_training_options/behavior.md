One on one training sessions work best for diagnosing and modifying behavioral issues such as aggression, destructive chewing, house training, separation anxiety, fearful, reactivity to other people/dogs, and more. Behavioral issues are challenging for even the most dedicated owner and they are also the types of behaviors put dogs most at risk for being relinquished to shelters. Thus addressing and modifying these behaviors are a core focus point of our mission. In these sessions we can diagnose the behaviors we are seeing and discuss possible causes and solutions to modifying the undesired behavior.
