We do training on your time, at your house, when you’re available. Here we can work on a large array of common “nice” manner behaviors such as waiting to go through doors, walking on a loose leash, not jumping on guests, to basic obedience items such as sit, come, down, and even tricks like wave, jump, shake, and more. Training these basic behaviors builds the bond between you and your dog. And as a bonus, you’ll have a new wonderfully polite member of the family.
