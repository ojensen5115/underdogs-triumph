Savannah Thompson is the co-director of Underdogâ€™s Triumph. Savannah volunteered at the [TLC Canine Center](https://www.tlccaninecenter.org/) in Newell, IA while she was in college, and helped lead the Beaver Animal Rescue and Care (BARC) organization during that time. She has strong passion for animal welfare and nonprofit work. After pursuing her graduate degree in writing/communications in Nevada, Savannah returned to Iowa to work in nonprofit communications.

Savannah shares her home in Des Moines with several rescued animals, including one rescued dog (an 11-year-old wire-haired terrier mix named Emmett who strongly resembles a goofy hyena) and three rescued cats.
