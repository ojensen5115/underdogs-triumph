Ellen Hartstack is the director of Underdogâ€™s Triumph. She has previously worked for over 10 years at the [TLC Canine Center](https://www.tlccaninecenter.org/) in Newell, IA rehabilitating, evaluating, and training the rescued dogs there. She is a lifelong-learner in dog behavior and training methods, and is eager to try new things. She received her certification as a professional dog trainer via the [CATCH Canine Training Academy](http://catchdogtrainers.com/) and a participant in the [Spring into Transformation Naughty but Nice](http://nbn.absolute-dogs.com/3-minute-gamechanger-fo) professional program. She is a member of multiple online resources such as the [Association of Professional Dog Trainings (APDT)](https://apdt.com/) and Naughty but Nice by Absolute Dogs. Ellen continues to be educated on the latest dog force/fear free dog training methods via dog training/behavioral books, and seminars/videos by renowned behaviorists like Ian Dunbar or Victoria Stilwell.

She has a passion for learning and helping others. She enjoys seeing owners unlock understanding of dog communication, and allowing them to see the true potential of their own dogs. When she is not training dogs, she works full time at a local tech company doing all manner of complicated tech wizardry. In her spare time she also is a serving councilwoman on the Luther City Council, volunteering at Girls Who Code, or relaxing doing one of her many other hobbies. She shares her home with three rescued dogs: a seven year old Jack Russell Terrier / Shih Tzu mix named Esther from the [TLC](http://tlccaninecenter.org/), a three year old Sheltie/Papillon mix named Luna from [Aheinz57](https://www.aheinz57.com/) and a ten year old deaf/blind rescue named Prim. She also has two crazy rescued cats: a very chatty, three year old gray/white short haired named Inara, and a fourteen year old, a young at heart, pure white long haired named Cass, both from the [Boone Area Humane Society](http://bahs.us/).
