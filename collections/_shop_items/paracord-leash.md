This custom hand-woven paracord leash is crafted into a four strand braid with custom extra wide handle for added comfort and swivel hook to attach to your dogs collar or harness. Paracord is a very strong, slightly stretchy material with each cord having a breaking strength of 550 lbs!

There are a variety of colors and two lengths gives your leash a nice pop and makes them perfect for a unique expression of your dog’s personality.

Short Leashes are between 3-4 feet from handle to clasp. These work great for large or tall dogs so you don’t have so much slack to carry around.

Standard Leashes are between 5-7 feet from handle to clasp. These work for any type or shape of dog.

As all leashes are custom woven and hand made, there may be some variation in the colors from the photo’s displayed. If you have a specific color or color combination you’d like, please let us know and we’ll do our best to accommodate you.

Additionally, as with all leashes (store bought or homemade), please ensure you check the leash for any fraying or tears before each walk.
