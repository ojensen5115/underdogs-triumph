# Underdog's Triumph

This is the new website concept repository.

Some things to remember:

- Build the docker container via `make`. This may take a while.
- Serve the site locally via `make run`.
- Pretty much everything you might need to edit is in the `collections` and `pages` folders.
- When adding a `featured-img` photo for a blog post, put the photo in `_img/posts/`, then run `make img` to generate the various necessary sizes
